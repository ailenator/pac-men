The program uses Javascript and HTML to dislay multiple instances of the Pac-Man character using "Add PacMan" button and "Start Game" to initiate the run of the program.

## Usage

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ailenator/javascript-pac-men.git`
- Open up folder: `pac-men`
- Drag and drop the file `index.html` onto your favorite browser of choice
> [!NOTE]
> Click on the **Start Game** button to start the program and **Add PacMan** to add multiple instances of Pac Man. Close the browser tab/window when done with the game.

- [x] Completed program to be able to instantiate multiple instances of the Pac-Man character.
